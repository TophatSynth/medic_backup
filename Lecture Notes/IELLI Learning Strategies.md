## MAP 
### Manage your time and wellbeing
- Don't multitask
- Achievable goals
- Break down tasks into smaller tasks - more manageable
- Parkinson's law - A task will expand to fit the time allotted. Limit the time given to each task to _only_ how much it needs. 
	- Work on stuff that you can define a timeslot first, then tackle the "undefined time" ones. 
- To do lists
	- Thing and time
	- Double your estimate of how long it'll take, esp at first
	- Tick it off
- Review review review! 
	- Anki and stuff. You rmbr. 
	- Review lecture content immediately after lecture, then weekly review both for past week and cumulative content. 
### Adopt positive goals
- Define success for yourself; everyone has a diff. definition, so don't compare yourself to them. 
- SMART targets -. _ -.
	- Set yourself priorities and targets for them. 
- What are my priorities? 
	- Academics - pass and survive....
	- frisbee - go to training at least once a week, preferably twice a week
	- jogging - once every fortnight
	- social - one social thing every week (homegroup doesn't count)
	- dnd - once every month
	- toastie - once every month
	- church - every week service and homegroup
- Effort is not evidence of failure, but rather is necessary for success. 
- Others' success is not a evidence tat you're falling behind, but rather proof that you can achieve the same. 
### Pursue effective learning strategies
- Tailored active learning methods
	- Review notes regularly, do what works for you specifically
	- Chunking: put things into blocks (waffle)
	- Elaboration: Stories/connections (spaghetti)
	- Concrete > abstract: Specific examples over abstract concepts
	- Dual coding: combination of text, pictures, audio, etc
	- _Active_ over passive learning: working w the info instead of reabsorbing it. Eg teaching, flashcards, past papers, mind maps, summaries etc
		- One page summaries, anki, practice tests, diagrams
