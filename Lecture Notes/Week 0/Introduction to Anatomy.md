Practicing medicine involves:
- Physical/clinical examination
- Carrying out procedures
- Interpreting medical images (scans, xrays etc)
- Communicate w/ colleagues/patients
	- Anatomy is the desc. language of medicine 

Why study anatomy?
- To diagnose problems, you need to know the "default" first, and be able to identify normal and not normal variation related to age, gender etc

A lot of anatomy history. Bleh.
