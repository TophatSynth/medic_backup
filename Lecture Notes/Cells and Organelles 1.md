Eukaryotes: Has membrane lined organelles 
- "Ew, keep your stuff away from my stuff."

## Cell theory
- All organisms consist of one or more cells
- The cell is the basic unit of all organisms
- New cells originate from preexisting cells
- Energy flow (eg metabolism and biochemistry) occurs within cells
- Cells carry DNA which are transferred from one cells to another
- Cells possess the same basic chemical compositions

## Properties of cells 
- They act as independent units, originate from preexisting cells, have a finite lifespan (either by design, age or disease), and have internal processes that allow them to change/adapt/respond to stimuli/changes in env. 
- Plasma membrane encloses the cell as a protective sheath 
	- Separates intracellular and extracellular fluid (ICF/ECF)
	- Semipermeable, regulates exchange of molecules between ICF and ECF 
	- Phospholipid bilayer
		- Polar head group, cholesterol structure, hydrophobic tail
			- Cholesterol provides rigidity to the layers (via steroid rings) while still allowing mobility
		- 2 each "layer" is called a leaflet
		- ![[Pasted image 20250916102030.png]]
		- Made of 5 main phospholipids
			- Outer leaflet - phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin
			- Inner leaflet - phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine & phosphatidylinositol
			- "phosphatidyl-"
			- Phosphatidylserine - translocated to signal that the cell is dying

### Membrane proteins
- Small, uncharged molc. and hydrophobic molecules can move in and out of the cell easily, but others need help to move through PM
#### Transport proteins
- 2 types of membrane transport proteins:
	- Channel proteins
		- A tube/pore through the PM for molecules of certain size
		- Regulates how much is allowed to move
		- Passive transport
	- Carrier proteins
		- Selectively binds to certain molecules, conformational changes to shuttle the molecule through PM into the cell
		- Active transport, powered by ATP hydrolysis
- Medical importance of transport proteins 
	- Cystic fibrosis usually has a defective chloride transport protein in epithelia, sweat ducts and cells lining the resp. tract. 
		- Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a carrier protein but functions as a Cl- channel protein
		- Mutation in CFTR gene results in defective channel protein
#### Other membrane proteins
- Receptor proteins 
	- receptors for hormones/neurotransmitters
- Enzymes
	- Allows the cell surface to catalyse stuff
- Linking proteins
	- Gives strc to PM, and hold cells tgth/participate in movement
- Cell identity markers
	- Person-specific markers
### Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes
- Prokaryotes 
	- No membrane bound organelles
	- Usually round, rod shaped or spiral
	- DNA found in the nucleoid, single chromosome
	- 1-10 microns in size
- Eukaryotes
	- Membrane bound organelles
	- Multiple linear DNA molc's 
	- ~10+microns in size

## Eukaryotic organelle systems 

### Protein expression
- DNA -> mRNA -> protein
- Transcription and translation
- 

### Secretion

### Uptake and degradation
