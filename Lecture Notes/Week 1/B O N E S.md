## Function of bone
- Enables movement via attachment of muscles
- Protection of vital organs
- Structural support
- Storage of minerals - Ca2+, PO4, Mg
- Haematopoiesis - Blood cell formation!!
## Structure of bone
- What is bone? - Not dead
	- Comprised of a collagen fibre framework (gel-like substance) hardened by precipitation of calcium phosphate crystals (hydroxyapatite crystals)
	- Collagen makes it flexible and provides tensile strength, crystals make it hard and provides compressive strength  - structural strength but not brittle
- All of the bone is replaced about every 8 - 12 years
### Lone bone structure
- Strc:
	- Epiphysis 
		- The "head"
	- Diaphysis
		- The shaft bit 
		- Hollow cylinder containing bone marrow
	- Metaphysis
		- Middle bit bt head and shaft
	- Periosteum
		- Fibrous sheath covering the outside of th bone

- 2 major kinds of bone
	- Trabecular/Cancellous (Spongy and porous)
		- Makes up the inside of the epiphysis
		- Trabeculae are laid down along lines of stress, allowing distribution of stresses. Makes the bone much much stronger while allowing for flexibility

			- Spongy so can store calcium and bone marrow easier than rest of bone
	- Cortical (Completely solid)
		- On the outside of the shaft
		- Provides stiffness and strength
		- 
### Blood supply
- Volkman's canals travelling transverse through the bones
- Haversian canals travelling longitudinally through the bones
- ![[Pasted image 20250918092835.png]]
- The cortical bone will align concentrically around the Haversian canals
	- Not all bone cells are in direct contact to the blood
	- But each bone cell has projections where it can send signals to neighbouring cells for communication
### Composition
- The collagen within bones is arranged in a parallel arrangement all throughout both types of bone

- Bone cells
	- Osteoblast
		- Bone building cell
		- When stimulated, will deposit collagen (organic matrix) then hydroxyapatite
		- Some become entombed in the bone in this process -> mature into osteocytes
	- Osteoclast
		- Bone chewing cell
		- Multinucleate - several cells fused together
		- "Suckers" itself with a "sealing zone" onto the bone
		- Moves around on bone, releasing H+ and hydrolytic enzymes to dissolve it
		- Liberates calcium and breaks down the extracellular matrix, to be recycled somewhere else
		- Regulated by hormones and osteoblasts
	- Osteocyte
		- "Fixed" bone cell, cannot move
		- Embedded within lacunae
		- Communicate via canaliculi (finger-like projections) to neighbouring cells
	- Osteoprogenitor cell
		- Stem cells lining the surface of bone
		- From which osteoblasts and osteoclasts derive
- Bone is a highly dynamic tissue in equilibrium bt building and destroying. Bone is constantly remodelled throughout life. 
	- Trabecular bone remodelling cycle
		- ![[Pasted image 20250918094817.png]]
		- Osteoclasts destroy section of bone, osteoprogenitors differentiate into osteoblasts, they lay down new bone
		- Regularly done to repair microdamage
	- Cortical bone remodelling
		- Osteon - "cutting cone"
		- Tunnels through the bone and lays down new bone behind

	- Wolff's law
		- Bone adapts to the load under which it is placed. Use it or lose it.

## Growth of bone
- Cartilage model formed, replaced by bone in ossification in infancy
