## Learning anatomy
- Eponym: A term that's been named after a person
- Some strc's have multiple different names
- Better to understand than memorise
	- Associations bt structures (vasculature, innervation, clinical, etc), small consistent revision
- Surface anatomy - how structures in the body map onto the skin
- Medical imaging 
	- Radiograph (xray), Computed tomography (CT), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound

## Anatomical terms
- Anatomical position
	- Upright, face forward, upper limbs on each side w/ palms forward (thumbs away from body), feet tgth
- Anatomical planes
	- Median plane - Right down the middle
	- Sagittal plane - Offset from the median plane
	- Frontal/coronal plane - front facing
	- Transverse plane - horizontal plane

- Positional terminology
	- Superior/inferior (cranial/caudal)- above, below
	- Anterior/posterior (ventral/dorsal) - in front/behind
	- Lateral/medial - further/closer to the midline
	- Superficial/intermdeiate/deep
	- Proximal/distal - closer/further from point of origin
	- Plantar/dorsal - front/back of hands/feet
	- ![[Pasted image 20250916091652.png]]
- Longitudinal/transverse/oblique
	- ![[Pasted image 20250916091717.png]]
- Ipsilateral/contralateral - same/opposite side
- Unilateral/bilateral - one/both sides

### Skin
- Integumentary system  
	- Epidermis
		- Keratinised epithelium (protective outside layer of cells)
		- Has some nerve endings
		- Avascular (no blood vessels)
		- Sheds 2 grams of dead cells a day and regenerates
	- Dermis
		- Collagenous (collagen) and rich in elastin -> tough and stretchy
		- Vascular and innervated
		- has hair follicles, arrector pili muscles (goosebumps), sweat glands
	- Hypodermis (subcutaneous tissue)
		- Stores adipose tissue (fat)
		-  Vascular and innervated, and has sweat glands
			- Sweat glands - 2 types
				- Eccrine - water and some electrolytes - present on almost all skin
				- Apocrine - lipid/protein rich secretion - axillae, perineal, genital areas, activates in puberty
- Functions: Protection, containment, thermoregulation, sensory, vitamin D synthesis/protection from UV (melanin), can absorb medications
- Langer's lines - lines of tension within the skin, made by the main orientation of collagen fibres in the skin

### Skeleton
- Axial/appendicular skeleton
	- Axial - skull, vertebrae, scarum, ribs, coccyx, hyoid, sternum (the "middle" stuff)
	- Appendicular - everything else attached to it
	- ![[Pasted image 20250916092624.png]]

### Nervous system
- CNS/PNS
	- Sensory
		- Somatic - body wall
		- Visceral - organs
	- Motor
		- Autonomic (visceral motor) - Sympathetic/parasympathetic (fight or flight/rest and digest)
		- Somatic motor
- Structure
	- Axon -> dendrites (connects to next axon)
	- Neurons supported/covered/protected by glial cells
		- Schwann cell, 
	- Comm. bt neurons via neurotransmitters
	- Ganglion (pl. ganglia) - collection of nerve cell bodies outside the CNS
	- CNS covered in protective meninges
		- Dura mater - tough outer layer
		- Arachnoid layer - subarachnoid space of CSF
		- Pia mater - closely adhered to brain/spinal cord
	- PNS 
		- 31 Spinal pairs total: 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, 1 coccygeal
		- C/T/L/S
		- 12 cranial pairs total 
			- Functions mostly in the head/neck, except vagus nerve (CNX)
		- !!!!!!!!!!!
	- Autonomic - self governing
		- Sympathetic - fight or flight
			- Cell bodies for SNS are in the T1 - L3
		- Parasympathetic - rest and digest 
			- Cell bodies for PSNS are in the brain stem and S2 - 4
			- 
## Embryology - Development of body cavities
- The human body is a tube - we are a pool noodle
	- Or that the human body is one tube, the GI tract is another tube
- Abdominopelvic/peritoneal cavity - digestive/reproductive organs
- Thoracic cavity - Pleural/pericardial (lungs/heart)
- Each cavity has a visceral (organ) and parietal (body wall) surface with lubricating fluid in bt. 
	- These are "potential spaces" where fluid can flow into and build up
	- Leads to infection, fluid (blood) loss, etc

### Dev. of body cavities
- Zygote becomes blastocyst, implants into uterus by day 7-9
- Inner cell mass of blastocyst becomes 2 layers of cells called epiblast and hypoblast
- Epiblast forms into trilaminar disk (proc. gastrulation) 
	- Ectoderm, Mesoderm, Endoderm
	- Paraxial, intermideate, lateral plate mesoderm 
		- Lateral plate splits into parietal and visceral layers 
		- ![[Pasted image 20250916094755.png]]
		- This splitting forms cavities (coelom) filled with coelomic fluid in horseshoe pattern around the developing head
- Disc folds cranio-caudally and laterally
	- Lateral folding causes body to fold over the gut tube
	- ![[Pasted image 20250916095123.png]]
	- Cranio-caudal folding
		- !!!!!!
- Eventually get a separationg of pleural cavity, peritoneal cavity, pericardial cavity
