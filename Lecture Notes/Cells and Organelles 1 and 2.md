Eukaryotes: Has membrane lined organelles 
- "Ew, keep your stuff away from my stuff."

## Cell theory
- All organisms consist of one or more cells
- The cell is the basic unit of all organisms
- New cells originate from preexisting cells
- Energy flow (eg metabolism and biochemistry) occurs within cells
- Cells carry DNA which are transferred from one cells to another
- Cells possess the same basic chemical compositions

## Properties of cells 
- They act as independent units, originate from preexisting cells, have a finite lifespan (either by design, age or disease), and have internal processes that allow them to change/adapt/respond to stimuli/changes in env. 
- Plasma membrane encloses the cell as a protective sheath 
	- Separates intracellular and extracellular fluid (ICF/ECF)
	- Semipermeable, regulates exchange of molecules between ICF and ECF 
	- Phospholipid bilayer
		- Polar head group, cholesterol structure, hydrophobic tail
			- Cholesterol provides rigidity to the layers (via steroid rings) while still allowing mobility
		- 2 each "layer" is called a leaflet
		- ![[Pasted image 20250916102030.png]]
		- Made of 5 main phospholipids
			- Outer leaflet - phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin
			- Inner leaflet - phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine & phosphatidylinositol
			- "phosphatidyl-"
			- Phosphatidylserine - translocated to signal that the cell is dying

### Membrane proteins
- Small, uncharged molc. and hydrophobic molecules can move in and out of the cell easily, but others need help to move through PM
#### Transport proteins
- 2 types of membrane transport proteins:
	- Channel proteins
		- A tube/pore through the PM for molecules of certain size
		- Regulates how much is allowed to move
		- Passive transport
	- Carrier proteins
		- Selectively binds to certain molecules, conformational changes to shuttle the molecule through PM into the cell
		- Active transport, powered by ATP hydrolysis
- Medical importance of transport proteins 
	- Cystic fibrosis usually has a defective chloride transport protein in epithelia, sweat ducts and cells lining the resp. tract. 
		- Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a carrier protein but functions as a Cl- channel protein
		- Mutation in CFTR gene results in defective channel protein
#### Other membrane proteins
- Receptor proteins 
	- Receptors for hormones/neurotransmitters
- Enzymes
	- Allows the cell surface to catalyse stuff
- Linking proteins
	- Gives strc to PM, and hold cells tgth/participate in movement
- Cell identity markers
	- Person-specific markers
### Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes
- Prokaryotes 
	- No membrane bound organelles
	- Usually round, rod shaped or spiral
	- DNA found in the nucleoid, single chromosome
	- 1-10 microns in size
- Eukaryotes
	- Membrane bound organelles
	- Multiple linear DNA molc's 
	- ~10+microns in size

## Eukaryotic organelle systems 

### Protein expression
- DNA -> mRNA -> protein
- Transcription and translation (done on ribosomes)
- Nucleus is a cell compartment. The outside bit is the nuclear envelope, with nuclear pores
- DNA is packaged with histones, forms chromatin (the little yoyo thingy)
	- Packaged in two ways â€“ euchromatin and heterochromatin. 
		- Euchromatin: Has most of the active genes
		- Heterochromatin: Inactive genes, and is more dense
- Translation
	- Chromosomes translate mRNA into protein chains 
		- Have a small and large subunit
	- Many ribosomes remain "free" and unbound during translation
		- These are usually for the organelles within the cell
	- Some bind to the endoplasmic reticulum -> rough ER
		- The polypeptide chain will have a starting "signal sequence" that binds to the ER, binding the ribosome there too
		- These are destined for the PM or nuclear membrane
- RER
	- Site of membrane protein synthesis
	- Modifies proteins - adds sugar chains, disulfide bonds, trims proteins
	- Quality control - monitors folding and destroys misfolds etc
	- Signals stress - if these is poorly folded/secretion is blocked etc
- SER <- no protein synthesis, bc no ribosomes!
	- Membrane lipid synthesis
	- Steroid synthesis
	- Detoxification
### Secretion
- Secretory pathway: RER -> Golgi apparatus -> secretory vessicle
- ![[Pasted image 20250916105105.png]]
	- Vessicles carry "cargo" (secretory proteins, membrane, etc) from RER to the Golgi
	- Golgi sorts cargo into each type
	- Vessicles bud from golgi containing cargo, go towards cell membrane
- Golgi is essentially the central warehouse for the decentralised RER
- Hydrolases are specifically modified by mannose phosphorylation to have mannose-6-phosphate residues on it to identify them. See [[Cells and Organelles 1 and 2#Lysosomes and endosomes| Lysosomes and endosomes below]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20250916105434.png]]
- The lumen (inside) of a membrane bound organelle is equivalent to the exterior of the cell
	- The same leaflet of the outside of the PM is the same as the leaflet on the inside of a membrane bound organelle
- Trans-golgi network compartment - the exit point of vesicles from the golgi

- 3 major pathways of secretion
	- Constitutive pathway
		- Direct transport to PM or recycling endosomes
			- Recycling - when transporting proteins, part of the endosome splits off to go back to the golgi to pick up more proteins
	- Regulated secretory pathway
		- Mature secretory granule - Waits for a signal to then secrete contents
	- Lysosomal pathway
		- Late endosomes fuse with hydrolase-containing vesicles to form lysosomes

- Transport vesicles are pulled in the cell along microtubules by motor proteins
	- Motor proteins - Kinesin pulls away from the nucleus (towards positive end), Dynein pulls it towards negative end 
		- Dynein - "die" -> negative end
	- Microtubules - most emanate from centrosome
		- Golgi usually located close to the centrosome
		- ![[Pasted image 20250917111139.png]]
	- Centrosome serves as initiation site for assembly, growth and organisation of microtubules 
 

### Uptake and degradation
#### Lysosomes and endosomes
- Membrane bound organelles containing about 60 diff types of acid hydrolases (degradative enzymes) 
	- Lysozymes are a type of hydrolase
	- The pH within a lysosome is ~5, which is the optimal pH for the hydrolases
	- They merge with endosomes containing proteins to be destroyed and undergo autophagy to destroy them 
- Clinical example of lysosomal enzyme abnormality
	- Lysosomal storage diseases - mutation in genes that encodes lysosomal enzymes
	- Gaucher disease - mutation that encodes lysosomal enzyme for the breakdown of glycolipids
		- Type I - Spleen, liver enlargement and bone lesion. Doesn't affect lifespan, not v serious, most common
			- Serine sub. asparagine
		- Type II - Extensive neurological involvement, severe and rare, most often in infancy and results in early death
		- Type III - early onset of neurological symptoms (eg dementia and spasticity) at around 10yo. Intermediate severity
			- Both Type II and III -> Proline sub. leucine 
- Lysosome formation
	- Hydrolases undergo Mannose-6-phosphorylation to get Mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) groups bound to them in the Golgi. M6P receptors in the membrane of the vesicle bind to the M6P group, binding the hydrolases into the vesicle. 
	- These vesicles then merge with an early endosome. When it matures into a late endosome, proton pumps activate which lower the pH level of the endosome and activates the hydrolases, maturing the late endosome into a lysosome. 
	- Apparently late endosomes can also merge with the hydrolase vesicle, forming a lysosome. 
- Endosomes
	- Early endosome - has a single continuous compartment
	- Late endosome - multiple early endosomes fuse into one larger vesicle and the pH inside drops significantly to mature into a late endosome
		- Can have intraluminal vesicles - smaller vesicles inside the endosome, to compartmentalise different things. Therefore known also as multivesicular endosomes
		- Fuses with lysosomes
	- Recycling endosomes
		- Returns stuff from PM back to PM. Vesicles bind to it, and it releases another vesicle destined for the PM. 
		- Can also return proteins back to Golgi
- Types of endocytosis
	- Phagocytosis
		- Takes antigens into body in a phagosome, fuses it with lysosome, digests it
		- Done by beeg cells
	- Pinocytosis
		- Solutes bind to membrane, folds, becomes pinosome
	- Receptor-mediated endocytosis
		- Ligand binds to receptor 
		- Receptors are clustered together in a clathrin coated pit
		- Pit membrane folds further, dynamin "cuts" membrane to form vesicle, receptor taken into cell in clathrin-coated vesicle
		- Clathrin uncoats to fuse into early endosome, moves ligand-receptor complex into early endosome.
		- Ligand dissociates from receptor, receptor is moved back with vesicle membrane to recycling endosome to be put back into PM
		- From there, may be recycled or sent for degradation
- Pathological example of receptor-mediated endocytosis - LDL
	- LDL binds to receptor, moves into late endosome to fuse with hydrolase vesicles for degradation. LDL dissociates from receptor, receptor is recycled back into membrane and LDL is destroyed. 
	- Familial hypercholesterolemia has 3 causes
		- LDL receptor not properly transported from RER to Golgi
		- LDL-receptor complex does not cluster into vesicles on the PM
		- LDL receptor not recycled back to the PM
#### The Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS)
- Protein degradation by proteasome
	- Proteasome is a hollow barrel complex lined on the inside with proteolytic enzymes
	- Junk protein is tagged with ubiquitin (ubiquitination)
	- Degradation done in cytoplasm
- Ubiquitin-proteasome pathway
	- E3 binds to abnormal protein, then forms a complex with E2
	- E1 binds to ubiquitin, passes it to E2 then to E3, onto the protein
	- Repeat to form ubiquitin chain
	- Abnormal protein recognised, proteasome degrades it. 
	- Ubiquitin re-released to be used again


## Two great steps in prokaryote cell evolution

### 1. Compartmentalisation
- All cell membranes posses a distinct inside and outside face
	- Inside - cytosolic monolayer (faces cytosol)
	- Outside - non-cytosolic monolayer (faces not-cytosol)
- When vesicles fuse with other organelles or PM, the bilayers will be facing the right way

### 2. Mitochondria 
- Large non-nucleated cell engulfed a bacterium about 2B years ago -> became the mitochondria
- Main role is to generate ATP 
	- Enables cells to grow bigger 
	- Has two membranes - inner membrane folded in the interior
	- Contains own DNA, reproduces by dividing in two
	- Your mitochondria come from your mom
	- Has outer and inner membrane, then matrix inside
		- Matrix contains genome and enzymes required for citric acid cycle and fatty acid oxidation
		- Inner membrane contains enzymes for oxidative phosphorylation
## Cytoskeleton
- Moving, positioning, supporting, protecting
- Types of cytoskeletal filaments
	- Microtubules
		- Made of alpha and beta tubulin
		- ![[Pasted image 20250917113532.png]]
		- Form the mitotic spindle in centrosomes, and is involved in intracellular movement of organelles and vesicles
		- Grows from the positive end, destroyed from the negative end
	- Microfilaments
		- Made of actin filaments (microfilaments) - Double strands of actin + myosin
		- ![[Pasted image 20250917113723.png]]
		- Provides strc support and cell shape, support cell motility
		- Provides contractile forces which let the cells move around if needed
	- Intermediate filaments 
		- Static, not dynamic like the other two - most stablecytoskeleton
	- ![[Pasted image 20250917113843.png]]
	- Over 70 diff types of intermediate filaments
		- They support the nuclear envelope and cytoplasm
- Microvilli 
	- Projections of the PM supported by actin filaments. 
		- Actin filaments also are engaged in protrusions or extensions in cell movement, and phagocytosis
