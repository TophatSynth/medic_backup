## Case Study Analysis

You and Jelena are first year Medical Students working as Care Assistants in a Care Home over
the Spring Vacation. Muneeb Khan is a 75-year-old resident at the Care Home. You are in the
television room with Jelena getting residents settled after tea, when you hear a shout:
- Care home: may not have doctors/that much medically trained staff
	- Residential vs nursing 
		- Residential do have BLS training, but are not registered nurses
		- Nursing has some registered nurses who can perform more invasive procedures. 
- 1st year medical students 
	- Will probably have BLS training, but not much experience or training otherwise. 


“Come quickly! Something’s wrong with Muneeb!” shouts Muneeb’s friend Mark.
You look over and see Muneeb in a high-backed chair, slumped at an awkward angle. He is very still.
- "Slumped at an awkward angle" and very still in a high backed chair where you would normally be sat quite straight - you can already tell that something is wrong
- Implies whatever happened has just only very recently happened. 


As you come closer you note that his skin is a worrying colour and his upper dentures are protruding from his mouth. You look around as you approach.
- Skin - hypoxia?
- End of bed assessment - medications, stuff knocked over. 
	- Important to assess danger, bystanders, etc when you're approaching a situation 
	- Also assess the patient himself - body temp, wheezing, coughing etc 
		- If he's not breathing, the situation's urgency increases. 
- Upper dentures 
	- Could've choked on smth if he had been eating smth 
	- Potentially seizures pushing dentures out
	- Blood flow being blocked, leading to inflammation pushing the dentures out?
	- Tells you he's unconscious - if he was conscious he probably would've put the dentures back into place


You speak loudly to Muneeb, while gently shaking his shoulders, but get no response. You shout for additional help: “Can I get some help over here?”
- Shake and shout - no response to multiple stimuli tells you he's very likely unconscious 
- Very important to call for extra help and delegate tasks in this situation. 
	- More people can help cover things you may have missed either in assessment or response. 
	- Other ppl can also clear away bystanders - out of danger, make the surroundings less crowded/easier to work in

You decide to lay Muneeb on the floor. Jelena comes over to help you move him onto the floor.
- Check vital signs 
- Now engaging active role in the situation 
	- May be worried about legal consequences later on if you do engage
	- Good Samaritan Law - Out of a workplace env, if you perform CPR on someone, you won't get sued
	- Workplace indemnity covers CPR inside the workplace - actually has more legal protections than GSL 


You open Muneeb’s airway using the manoeuvres which you have been taught in Medical School and listen and feel for breathing while simultaneously feeling for his carotid pulse.
- Checking airway would lyk if he had been choking on smth 
	- Also ruling out allergic reactions

From your findings on assessment, you decide to put out an arrest call. You glance at the clock.
- Arrest call - no pulse detected
- Clock - golden time of 3 minutes, STARTING from when the heart stops, not when you realise it's stopped 
	- Time is of the utmost essence
	- 4 minutes (?) before braincells start to die of hypoxia


You speak to Jelena and ask her to phone for an ambulance, stating address, cardiac arrest and that CPR is on-going. “Remember”, you remind Jelena, “to bring back the defibrillator… Oh, and can you check his Advanced Care Plan? Also bring some staff to help.”
- Should've called 999 earlier bc they know they're inexperience medical students
- A lot of delegation to Jelena 
	- Good to have someone still around Muneeb while 999 is called and defib is brought
	- Jelena should probably delegate tasks further according to priority
	- Maybe should have delegated tasks to someone else instead, keeping the two BLS trained ppl by the patient. CPR is physically hard. 
- Advanced care plan 
	- Nurse contact info - useful for patient records and informing first responders of current medication and conditions 
		- May have things that affect what treatments are allowed
	- Also has next of kin contact info
		- V low priority though. 
- Emergency situation - tense and may not be thinking very well, stressed, first year medic. Can't critique them that much. 


While Jelena is away you commence cardiopulmonary resuscitation according to the UK Resuscitation 2021 BLS Guidelines which you were taught in Medical School.
- None 


Jelena returns with the defibrillator and other equipment and says she’s phoned 999. You switch roles as you are getting exhausted and set up the defibrillator while Jelena carries on with compressions and ventilations. As soon as the pads are on you ask Jelena to stop cardiac compressions.
- Put the defib on the patient, it will be able to detect whether a shock would fix the problem or not (will tell you "shock is not/advised"). 
	- Things like tachycardia that are also fixed with a defib would present differently from this situation 
	- "Shockable rhythm" - heart muscles trembling. 
		- Defib will stop it in that case. 
- Calling 999, you'd probably need to brief the paramedic on the situation and talk more than is stated here. 
	- They can also give instructions on BLS. Even if they are BLS trained, they're 1st year medics and probably very inexperienced, probably would appreciate clear instructions. 


You follow the instructions given by the voice from the defibrillator. You shout, “stand clear!” and look carefully around the casualty before you press the button to deliver a shock.
- Keeping people and surroundings clear 
	- So ppl aren't collaterally shocked, and there aren't any dangerous/sharp items in the area. 
- Defib is just placing pads on chest and pressing button. 

You immediately take over cardiac compressions from Jelena and she concentrates on breathing for the casualty. Meanwhile other Care Staff have arrived and are moving residents, some of whom are quite distressed, out of the TV room.
- Breathing for the patient uses the inflating bag on the mouth and nose. 


You continue to follow the instructions given by the voice from the defibrillator.
- None

You are both very relieved when, 7 minutes later, the paramedics arrive. You give an SBAR handover and the paramedics take over.
- 7 minute timeline is not quite as dire once CPR has been given. 


Jelena and you decide to go and get a cup of tea as you are both shaking a bit. You debrief with staff and fill in an incident report form.
- Debrief after the situation
	- WWWEBI - eg Delegating too many things to Jelena
	- Also decompressing after an emotionally strenuous and exhausting situation. 
		- Reassuring ppl that they've done the best they could. 


## Further Questions and Notes

- "How would you be feeling/thinking in this situation?"
	- So easy to judge when it's a piece of paper, but a lot more terrifying in person
	- Extreme emotional and psychological stress from the whole situation, whether the patient dies or survives
		- Poor follow up for both staff and patient if they survive. Resources have only now recently started being considered and developed. 
- Advanced care plan is now called Future Care Plan 
- No more routine pulse checks. Just open airway, check for signs of life, then make a decision. 
	- Look for breathing, coughing, swallowing
	- Don't usually check pupil dilation etc bc that takes time
- Debriefing the staff
	- Hot vs cold debriefs 
		- Hot - immediately after, mostly just checking in that everyone's okay
		- Cold - later on, once people have calmed down, more detail. 
			- STOP - Summarise, Things that went well, opportunities to improve, plan for next time. 
- Briefing staff before helping situation
	- Usually staff should be trained in BLS, so just saying "cardiac arrest" should be enough info.
