- Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation
- ![[Pasted image 20250913164521.png]]

1. **Situation**. Concisely identify the current situation and give a description of the purpose for this communication.  Who are you?  Why are you initiating this SBAR? What is happening currently?

 2. **Background**. Put the current situation into its context. Give a brief overview of the reason you are doing this work/project. 

 3. **Assessment**. This is the section where you might go into a little more detail and be very clear about the message you wish to communicate.
	- Outline of where the project currently is, key findings and data analysis, knowledge you have built through testing thus far, and/or any barriers encountered. 
	- The tone could be positive or negative (or both) depending on the purpose of your communication. Is it a routine update? Is it a pitch to get more funding, time or spread opportunities? Are you making the case to abandon? This section will be shaped depending on the specific aim of your SBAR.

 4. **Recommendation**. Your recommendation may vary depending on what stage you are at with your project, and what the purpose of the SBAR is:
	- Early stage: how could the project be set up? Who should be involved? How will you work together and make decisions?
	- Mid stage: suggestions for next steps based on knowledge built so far. Is there something that should be abandoned? Something that should be tested further? Or perhaps a new change idea?
	- End stage: recommendations for scale-up and spread? Context specific learning to captured for spread stage?
